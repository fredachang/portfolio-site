# Portfolio Website 

This is my portfolio website built using react and elements of Three.js. The UI is designed to mimic the look of book ends and that feeling of exploration when you are at the bookstore, not quite knowing what you are going to get until you've grabbed the book off the shelf. The animations on the site are done using Framer motion enabling easy layout transitions. A 3D welcome card is modelled in blender and loaded using GLTF loader.
